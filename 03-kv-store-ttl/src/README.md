Take a moment to orient yourself with this codebase first. 

When you're ready, tell me your understanding of what it does. 

Then, for the first task: 
I want you to add a ttl (time-to-live) feature. 
The set method should accept an optional third parameter — a number of milliseconds. 

If provided, the entry should expire after that duration. 
A get on an expired entry should return null, as if it doesn't exist. Entries set without a ttl should never expire."
